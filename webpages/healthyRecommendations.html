                        <h2>How these calculations work</h2>
                        <h3>Calculating Ideal Body Weight (IBW)</h3>
                        <p><b>What is IBW?</b><br>
                        Ideal Body Weight (IBW) is a guideline to estimate a healthy weight range for individuals based
                        on
                        their
                        height. It was originally developed for medical use to determine dosages and monitor health
                        risks.<br>
                        <b>How is it calculated?</b><br>
                        IBW is calculated using simple formulas that consider your height and gender. Different methods
                        provide
                        slightly varying results, but all aim to give a general idea of what a healthy weight might
                        be.<br>
                        Devine Formula: The most widely used method. It assumes an average body frame.<br>
                        For males: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IBW (kg) = 50 + 2.3 × (Height in inches−60)<br>
                        For females: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IBW (kg) = 45.5 + 2.3 × (Height in inches−60)<br>
                        <b>Why use IBW?</b><br>
                        IBW is a starting point to assess health and develop fitness goals. However, it doesn’t account
                        for
                        factors like muscle mass or body composition, so it should be used alongside other measurements
                        like
                        Body Mass Index (BMI) and body fat percentage.<br><br>
                        <h3>Daily Caloric Needs</h3>
                        Daily caloric needs represent the number of calories your body requires to maintain your current
                        weight.
                        This includes energy for basic functions (like breathing and digestion) and additional
                        activities
                        like
                        exercise.<br>
                        <b>How is it calculated?</b><br>
                        The process involves two steps: calculating your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and multiplying it
                        by an
                        activity factor.<br>
                        - Step 1: Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):<br>
                        This is the energy your body needs at rest. The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation is widely used:<br>
                        For males:<br>BMR (kcal/day) = 10 × Weight (kg) + 6.25 × Height(cm) − 5 × Age (years) + 5<br>
                        For females:<br>BMR (kcal/day) = 10 × Weight (kg) + 6.25 × Height(cm) − 5 × Age (years) - 161<br>
                        - Step 2: Activity Factor:<br>
                        Multiply your BMR by an activity factor based on your lifestyle:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sedentary: 1.2</li>
                            <li>Lightly active: 1.375</li>
                            <li>Moderately active: 1.55</li>
                            <li>Very active: 1.725</li>
                            <li>Extra active: 1.9</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Why use caloric needs?</b><br>
                        Understanding your caloric needs helps with weight management. Consuming more than your needs
                        leads
                        to
                        weight gain, while eating less leads to weight loss.<br><br>

                        <h3>Weight Loss/Gain Calculator</h3>
                        A weight loss/gain calculator estimates how long it will take to reach your target weight by
                        adjusting
                        your daily caloric intake.<br>
                        <b>How does it work?</b><br>
                        1. Determine Weight Difference:<br>
                        Calculate the difference between your current weight and your target weight.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weight Difference = ∣Current Weight − Target Weight∣<br>
                        2. Set Calorie Deficit or Surplus:<br>
                        To lose weight, create a calorie deficit (e.g., 500 fewer calories/day).<br>
                        To gain weight, create a calorie surplus (e.g., 500 extra calories/day).<br>
                        A deficit or surplus of 7700 calories equals roughly 1 kg of weight change.<br>
                        3. Estimate Weekly Weight Change:<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weekly Change (kg) =Daily Calorie Change × 7 / 7700<br>
                        4. Calculate Time to Goal:<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time (weeks) = Weight Difference (kg) / Weekly Change (kg)<br>
