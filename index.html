        <div id="content2">
            <section>
                <p>Pre-workout nutrition is essential to provide energy and prevent premature fatigue. Aim to eat a balanced meal of complex carbohydrates, lean protein and healthy fats 2-3 hours before your workout. If you're short on time, choose a light snack rich in easily digested carbohydrates 30-60 minutes before your workout. Examples include a banana, Greek yoghurt with granola or a fruit smoothie. Don't forget to hydrate properly by drinking 400-600 ml of water 2-3 hours before and 200-300 ml 10-20 minutes before your workout.</p>

                <!-- Image source from: https://marathontours.com/en-gb/marathon-training-plan/-->
                <p>Water is usually sufficient for exercise of less than 60 minutes. However, for longer or more intense workouts, it's important to replenish your energy stores and maintain hydration. Consume 30-60g of carbohydrates per hour and drink 120-240ml of fluid every 15-20 minutes. Sports drinks, energy gels or energy bars are good options to keep you going during long periods of exercise. These products are designed to provide fast-absorbing carbohydrates and electrolytes to maintain your performance.</p>

            <section >
                <p>Post-workout nutrition plays a vital role in muscle recovery and glycogen replenishment. Within 30-60 minutes of exercise, consume a combination of carbohydrates (0.5-0.7g per kg of body weight) and protein (20-30g). This could be a protein shake with a banana, Greek yoghurt with fruit and granola, or a chicken wrap with vegetables. Follow this up 2-3 hours later with a full meal of complex carbohydrates, lean protein, healthy fats and vegetables. Don't forget to rehydrate by drinking 450-675ml of fluid for every 0.5kg of weight lost during exercise. Remember, these are general guidelines and it's important to tailor your diet to your individual needs, type of training and specific goals.</p>

        <div id="content3">
            <section>
                <p> <b>1.Assessing your health</b><br>
                    It's important to assess your current health. Schedule a visit to your healthcare provider for a comprehensive physical examination, especially if you are new to strenuous activity or have pre-existing health conditions. A medical assessment can help identify potential risks and ensure that your exercise plan is tailored to your specific needs.<br>
                    <b>2. Create a realistic fitness plan</b><br>
                    The next step is to create a realistic and achievable fitness plan. Start by setting clear, measurable goals that align with your health goals, such as improving cardiovascular endurance or building strength. Incorporate a variety of exercises into your routine, including aerobic activities (such as walking or cycling), strength training (using weights or resistance bands), flexibility exercises (such as yoga) and balance training to create a well-rounded programme.<br>
                    <b>3. Establish consistency and hydration</b><br>
                    Consistency is key to maintaining a successful exercise routine.  To establish this routine, choose specific times for your workouts that fit seamlessly into your schedule. Also, prioritise hydration by drinking water before, during and after exercise to maintain optimal fluid levels. Starting slowly and giving your body time to adapt will help prevent injury and improve your overall fitness journey.</p>

                <p> <div id="tips">Tips for beginners</div><br>
                    <b>Hydration and Nutrition</b><br>
                    Staying hydrated is vital for optimal performance and recovery. Drink water consistently throughout the day and consider electrolyte-rich drinks during intense workouts, especially in hot conditions. Aim to consume 17-20 ounces of water 2-3 hours before exercising, and continue to hydrate during and after your workout.
                    Nutrition also plays a key role in supporting your fitness goals. A balanced diet should include carbohydrates for energy, protein for muscle recovery, and healthy fats for sustained energy.<br>
                    <b>Warm-Up and Cool-Down</b><br>
                    Warming up is essential to prevent injuries and enhance performance. Spend 5-10 minutes doing light aerobic exercises followed by dynamic stretches that mimic your workout movements. After exercising, take time to cool down with light activity and static stretches to help your body recover and reduce soreness.<br>
                    <b>Listening to Your Body</b>
                    It's important to listen to your body, especially as a beginner. If you feel pain or discomfort, stop exercising and rest. Progress at a manageable pace; gradually increase the intensity or duration of your workouts to avoid injury. Incorporate rest days into your routine to allow for recovery, ensuring long-term success in your fitness journey.
